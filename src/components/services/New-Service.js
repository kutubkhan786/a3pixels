    <li> programmer</li>
    <li> graphic artist</li>
    <li> project manager, etc.</li>
</ul></p><br/>
<p>
<b>PROCESS</b><br/>

At the start of the project, a team of experts is identified that will conceptualise, execute and finalise the project from start to delivery. This team of experts is constantly connected and works to seamlessly meet the client's requirements at all times.<br/><br/>
